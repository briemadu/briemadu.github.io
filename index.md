I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the LeipzigLab of the University of Leipzig, Germany, in the group [Climate Discourse](https://www.uni-leipzig.de/en/research/research-profile/leipziglab/climate-discourse). In this multidisciplinary project, I use data analysis and NLP techniques to investigate how discouse about extreme climate events around the world is shaped in the German media. As of December, 2025 I am also a guest researcher at the UFZ - Helmholz Centre for Enrivonmental Research, in the group [Computational Social Sciences for Extreme Events Research](https://www.ufz.de/index.php?en=46549) led by Dr. Mariana Madruga de Brito.

Before that, I was a research assistant at the University of Potsdam, Germany, from 2019 to 2025. I did my Ph.D as a member of the [Computational Linguistics Lab (colabPotsdam)](https://clp.ling.uni-potsdam.de/) led by Prof. David Schlangen. The focus of my interdisciplinary research was deep learning models and human dialogue, more specifically about computational modelling the process by which humans build common ground and understand each other, like incremental processing, scorekeeping and clarification requests. In my thesis, I discuss the design of theory-based evaluation methods bridging NLP and cognitive science to help us understand the limits of current neural network models to process language and dialogue. The title of my thesis is "Incrementally Enriching the Common Ground: Cognitively Motivated Evaluative Approaches to Dialogue Processing with Deep Learning Models". You can find it [here](https://doi.org/10.25932/publishup-66390).

I'm also broadly interested in all aspects about evaluation, ethics and responsible use of language technologies. I particularly enjoy doing data and error analysis. Besides, I am passsionate about teaching, learning and education.

I got my M.Sc. in Language Science and Technology at the University of Saarland, Germany, with a thesis project in the scope of the [SFB1102 Project A3](http://www.sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/?page_id=249) with Prof. Alexander Koller in 2019. I applied semi-supervised learning methods to extract script knowledge from texts. Before that, I received my B.Sc. in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the [Institute of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.ime.usp.br/en) of the University of São Paulo, Brazil, in 2015, with an exchange year at the TU Kaiserslautern, in Germany.
